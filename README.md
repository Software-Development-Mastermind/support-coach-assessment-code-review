Ryan has just completed a simple digital clock application in HTML/CSS & Javascript.  The project can be accessed here: [https://github.com/Software-Development-Mastermind/support-coach-assessment-code-review](https://github.com/Software-Development-Mastermind/support-coach-assessment-code-review)

He now is looking for feedback from you on how it can be improved.

Pull down his project on your computer and take a good look at how it works and see if you can give him suggestions for how he can improve it.

Some ideas for suggestions:
 - Getting rid of unnecessary code
 - Naming
 - Structure
 - Anything else you can think of

*Don't overthink this one*...give feedback like you would to a friend so they could make their code even just 1% better.
